Taking the last first -- 
WIND SPEED:
From my accumulated trivia knowledge: Winds pick up through the middle of the day as sun increases the thermal energy of the atmosphere, stirring up choppy waters for boating and airplane turbulence; this calms as the sun sets, if not confounded by other factors. 

3/22/19 saw clear skies and calm waters locally, and wind speeds reflect this trend across the 3 sessions of API data retrieval, showing a wider range of wind speeds in the afternoon that calm after sunset.
CLOUDINESS vs. LATITUDE showed a clustering at 0% and 100% suggesting that cloud formation is triggered and accelerated toward extremes (consistent with water particles' bipolar charge and surface tension.)

***There are outlier cities with high wind speeds at Lat +40-70˚. 
Unclear significance without considering confounding weather factors (with larger influence than the associations of latitude) in those areas during this period, OR without DATA COLLECTION OVER TIME, with each occurrence of (date/time/10minutes) collection being a sample element in a larger data set. Means over days or years would likely provide more generalizable trends. 

TEMP vs. LATITUDE: follows a predictable curve with highest temperatures at 0˚Lat where earth's axis does not limit sun exposure and atmospheric warming.

HUMIDITY vs. LAT:  2 outliers at 6:30pm, but otherwise a ceiling of 100% likely representing precipitation, and very few values below 20%.

***IN GENERAL -- Consider that fewer values are recorded outside of 20-40˚ + or -, as those temperate areas best support both health and wealth for humans, and therefore surplus of resoures to permit sharing of weather data. 

***There is more LAND MASS at northern latitudes +40-60˚, so more human population doing the recording there as a result.
